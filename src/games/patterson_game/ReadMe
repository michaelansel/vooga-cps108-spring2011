Regarding the final refactoring project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For the final project I refactored the games.patterson_game.refactoredVooga.levelsRefactored package which includes AbstractLevel, 
IGoal, IRenderable, IUpdatable, LevelException, LevelManager, SpritePool and VoogaPlayField. 
I did not, however, work on the levels.util package which was designed primarily by the resources team.

Regarding the game
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To play:
	Use the arrow keys to move your ship.
	Collect the powerups (which are the blue triangle things floating across the screen) by running into them
	Shoot floating objects by pressing the space bar (The red blocks are obstacles and the small gray circles are explosives)
	Some floating objects require many hits to kill
	Don't die (your health is in the upper left-hand corner)
