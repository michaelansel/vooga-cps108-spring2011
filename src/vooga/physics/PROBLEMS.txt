Problems:

1. List possible collision pairs (which is gross)
	Maybe can fix with reflection?
	Check if method exists?
	Catch exceptions?
2. Swappable components
3. Double application of collisions because of looping
	Define interface preferences
4. Local Forces

Thoughts:

1. dv <= force, length of time of application
	dv collision <= another object's collision behavior
2. changing parameters to not interfaces
