 * Abstract UI class. Extend and customize this as desired. Call update when your

 * width, etc, etc.
 * 
 * The important idea is to abstract your UI away from your gamestate. You can draw
 * all your players, then simply call this method after, which could contain a border,
 * display of your health, display of your score, or any number of other things.
